# what I have learned!
- About the implementation principle of the log library. We often have to write one ourselves, don't we?
- X-MACOR method. Surprised!g A great alternative to the `switch` keyword method.
- Use static and inline keywords to circumvent ODR rules.
- Encapsulation technique. A little exercise.
